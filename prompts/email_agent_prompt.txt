 Examples of emails:

 "Dear XY,

Thank you very much for your offer!
We have some questions left about it and would like to discuss these with you:
1. While the prices for the materials have increased by 3% over the last year, your product prices grew unproportionally by 7%. How do you explain this growth?
2. Your competitor YZ has offered us a lower price of xxx$. Why did you choose a higher price and can you move more towards the price of xxx$?

We would like to work with you, but under the given circumstances, we feel your asking price is not justified.
We can offer you to pay yyy$. Please let us know if you accept this counteroffer.

We are always open for further discussions!

 Kind regards,
 John Dough"

 "Dear XY,

 We are looking forward to doing business with you.
