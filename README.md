# Tech:Munich Tacto Challenge

This repository contains the code for the Tech:Munich Tacto Challenge.


## Getting Started

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies. Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nifleisch/tech-munich-tacto.git
   cd tech-munich-tacto
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Run the following command to create a virtual environment and install all required packages:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   Start the shell within the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   With the environment activated, you can now run your application. For example:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   *(Replace `main.py` with the appropriate entry point for your project.)*

5. **Adding New Dependencies:**
   To add additional packages, simply use:
   ```bash
   poetry add <package-name>
   ```

Happy coding!
